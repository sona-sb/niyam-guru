      "Issues_Framed": [
        {
          "Issue_Number": 1,
          "Issue": "Whether the mobile phone that exploded within one day of purchase can be considered a 'defective' good under the Consumer Protection Act, 2019?",
          "Analysis": "A product is expected to be safe and functional for its intended purpose. An explosion is a catastrophic failure that not only makes the product non-functional but also poses a grave safety risk. The incident occurred within 24 hours of purchase, making it highly improbable that the defect was caused by user wear and tear. Applying the principle of 'res ipsa loquitur', the event itself is strong evidence of a pre-existing defect.",
          "Finding": "Yes, the phone is held to be defective."

        {
          "Issue_Number": 2,
          "Issue": "Whether the seller's refusal to provide a remedy and blaming the user constitutes a 'deficiency in service'?",
          "Analysis": "The seller has a legal obligation to address grievances related to defective products sold by them. By summarily dismissing the consumer's complaint and shifting blame without any investigation or evidence, the seller has failed in their after-sales service obligations. This constitutes a clear inadequacy in the manner of performance required.",
          "Finding": "Yes, the seller is held to be deficient in service."

          "Issue_Number": 3,
          "Issue": "Whether the consumer is entitled to a refund and compensation?",
          "Analysis": "Given the findings on the first two issues, the consumer has suffered a financial loss (cost of the phone) and mental agony due to the traumatic incident and the seller's uncooperative attitude. As per the Act and precedents like Jose Philip Mampillil, the consumer is entitled to be compensated for both the price of the defective good and the consequential harassment.",
          "Finding": "Yes, the consumer is entitled to relief."
        }
      ],
      "Findings": "The court finds that the mobile phone was inherently defective at the time of sale, and the seller's subsequent refusal to address the issue amounts to a deficiency in service.

      ],
      "Legal_Principles": [
        "Res Ipsa Loquitur: The thing speaks for itself. The very nature of the incident (a new phone exploding) is evidence of negligence or defect.",
        "Product Liability: A seller or manufacturer is strictly liable for placing a defective product in the hands of a consumer.",
        "Duty of Care: Sellers have a duty to ensure the products they sell are safe for their intended use."
      ],
      "Contextual_Notes": "The Consumer Protection Act, 2019, has a strong pro-consumer bias. For a defect that occurs so soon after purchase, the burden of proof effectively shifts to the seller to prove that the product was not defective at the time of sale."
    },
    "Judgment_Reasoning": {
      "Issues_Framed": [
        {
          "Issue_Number": 1,
          "Issue": "Whether the mobile phone that exploded within one day of purchase can be considered a 'defective' good under the Consumer Protection Act, 2019?",
          "Analysis": "A product is expected to be safe and functional for its intended purpose. An explosion is a catastrophic failure that not only makes the product non-functional but also poses a grave safety risk. The incident occurred within 24 hours of purchase, making it highly improbable that the defect was caused by user wear and tear. Applying the principle of 'res ipsa loquitur', the event itself is strong evidence of a pre-existing defect.",
          "Finding": "Yes, the phone is held to be defective."
        },
        {
          "Issue_Number": 2,
          "Issue": "Whether the seller's refusal to provide a remedy and blaming the user constitutes a 'deficiency in service'?",
          "Analysis": "The seller has a legal obligation to address grievances related to defective products sold by them. By summarily dismissing the consumer's complaint and shifting blame without any investigation or evidence, the seller has failed in their after-sales service obligations. This constitutes a clear inadequacy in the manner of performance required.",
          "Finding": "Yes, the seller is held to be deficient in service."
        },
        {
          "Issue_Number": 3,
          "Issue": "Whether the consumer is entitled to a refund and compensation?",
          "Analysis": "Given the findings on the first two issues, the consumer has suffered a financial loss (cost of the phone) and mental agony due to the traumatic incident and the seller's uncooperative attitude. As per the Act and precedents like Jose Philip Mampillil, the consumer is entitled to be compensated for both the price of the defective good and the consequential harassment.",
          "Finding": "Yes, the consumer is entitled to relief."
        }
      ],
      "Findings": "The court finds that the mobile phone was inherently defective at the time of sale, and the seller's subsequent refusal to address the issue amounts to a deficiency in service. The seller's defense of user fault is dismissed as a baseless allegation without any supporting evidence.",
      "Key_Evidence": [

      },
      "Inference": "It is inferred that a product failing in such a dangerous and catastrophic manner within 24 hours of purchase is due to a manufacturing defect, unless proven otherwise with concrete evidence by the opposite party.",

        "The seller failed to provide any evidence to substantiate their claim of user fault.",
        "Therefore, the liability for the defective product and deficient service lies with the seller."
